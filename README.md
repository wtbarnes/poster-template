# Academic Poster Template

A template repository for posters in LaTeX.
This template is based on the [gemini](https://github.com/anishathalye/gemini) poster them with some custom modifications provided in the color scheme.
It also includes an example script for generating matplotlib plots in PGF format so that they inherit as much of the native styling of the document as possible.

If you use the LaTeX Workshop plugin for VS Code, this also includes some useful default settings.
